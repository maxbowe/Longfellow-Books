							<p>As a child, Jon tried desperately to be his father’s version of the all-American boy, denying his gayness in a futile attempt to earn the love and respect of an abusive man. With this he built a deep, internalized homophobia that made him want to disappear rather than live with the truth about himself. That denial played out in the forms of anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive running, which consumed him as an adolescent and young adult.<br>
It wasn’t until a grueling yet transformative Outward Bound experience that Jon began to face his sexual identity. This exploration continued as he entered college and started the serious work of sorting through years of repressed anger to separate from his father’s control and condemnation.<br>
My Thinning Years is an inspiring story of courage, creativity, and the will to live--and of recreating the definition of family to include friends, relatives, and teachers who support you in realizing your true self.<br>
"Jon Derek Croteau's powerful new book is a beacon shining on the puzzle of life." -Bob Dotson, New York Times bestselling author of American Story, a Lifetime Search for Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things<br>
“Jon Derek Croteau writes with unstinting honesty, and courageously explores the harmful effects of bullies long after they’ve left the scene. But he also reveals the plain fact that the greatest bully we have to win over is often the one within us.” -James Lecesne, co-founder, The Trevor Project<br>
