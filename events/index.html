						<h3>JON DEREK CROTEAU</h3>
						<h3>My Thinning Years</h3>
						<h5>Friday, September 26th, 7:00pm</h5>
							<p>As a child, Jon tried desperately to be his father’s version of the all-American boy, denying his gayness in a futile attempt to earn the love and respect of an abusive man. With this he built a deep, internalized homophobia that made him want to disappear rather than live with the truth about himself. That denial played out in the forms of anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive running, which consumed him as an adolescent and young adult.<br>
It wasn’t until a grueling yet transformative Outward Bound experience that Jon began to face his sexual identity. This exploration continued as he entered college and started the serious work of sorting through years of repressed anger to separate from his father’s control and condemnation.<br>
My Thinning Years is an inspiring story of courage, creativity, and the will to live--and of recreating the definition of family to include friends, relatives, and teachers who support you in realizing your true self.<br>
"Jon Derek Croteau's powerful new book is a beacon shining on the puzzle of life." -Bob Dotson, New York Times bestselling author of American Story, a Lifetime Search for Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things<br>
“Jon Derek Croteau writes with unstinting honesty, and courageously explores the harmful effects of bullies long after they’ve left the scene. But he also reveals the plain fact that the greatest bully we have to win over is often the one within us.” -James Lecesne, co-founder, The Trevor Project<br>

A senior partner at a leadership consultancy for higher education and healthcare clients across the globe, he is also deeply involved in several foundations and nonprofits, where he champions for equal rights and effective leadership. The author of three academic books on staff development and leadership as well as numerous articles for journals and periodicals, he is a highly sought-out speaker on the topics of eating disorder recovery, body image, and coming out.

					<h3>The Swap</h3><h3> Megan Shull</h3>
<h5>Tuesday, September 30th, 7:00pm at Longfellow Books <h5>
 <p>
This smart and funny twist on Freaky Friday is perfect for fans of Wendy Mass, Jerry Spinelli, and Jon Scieszka.
With one random wish, Jack and Ellie are living life in each other's shoes. He's her. And she's him. Ellie assumed popular guys didn't worry about body image, being perfect, or talking to girls, but acting like you're cool with everything is tougher than it looks.JACK thought girls had it easy—no fights with bullies, no demanding dads, no power plays—but facing mean girls at sleepovers and getting grilled about your period is way harder than taking a hit to the face at sports practice.<br>
Now they're dealing with each other's middle school dramas—locker room teasing, cliques, video game battles, bra shopping, and a slew of hilariously awkward moments—until they hopefully switch back! Told in both Jack's and Ellie's voices, The Swap offers a fresh and honest take on tween friendship, all while exploring more serious themes of family, loss, empathy, and what it really means to be yourself. And as Jon Scieszka says, it's "seriously, truly, fearlessly funny!"
 <br>
“The internal lives of both boy and girl come across as both authentic and heartwarming … Readers curious about how the other half lives will thrill at this view from the far side of the fence.” -Kirkus Reviews
<br>
“Bravo, Megan Shull! Hilarious and yet surprisingly touching at the same time, The Swap gives us a microscopically close insider’s view at the differences (and similarities) between the lives of boys and girls. I don’t know how Megan did it, but I’m really glad she did!” -Meg Cabot, author of The Princess Diaries<br>
Born and raised in Ithaca, New York, Megan Shull is the author of several books for kids including the award-winning young adult novel Amazing Grace. Megan holds a doctorate in educational psychology from Cornell University, where she also earned her undergraduate degree. She lives in her hometown, where she feels especially lucky to walk the quiet rolling hills alongside red-tailed hawks and waterfalls.  Bring the whole family to hear Megan read from her latest YA book, ask your questions and get your books signed!
