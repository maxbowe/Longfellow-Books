						This smart and funny twist on Freaky Friday is perfect for fans of Wendy Mass, Jerry Spinelli, and Jon Scieszka.
						With one random wish, Jack and Ellie are living life in each other's shoes. He's her. And she's him. Ellie assumed popular guys didn't worry about body image, being perfect, or talking to girls, but acting like you're cool with everything is tougher than it looks.JACK thought girls had it easy—no fights with bullies, no demanding dads, no power plays—but facing mean girls at sleepovers and getting grilled about your period is way harder than taking a hit to the face at sports practice.<br>
						Now they're dealing with each other's middle school dramas—locker room teasing, cliques, video game battles, bra shopping, and a slew of hilariously awkward moments—until they hopefully switch back! Told in both Jack's and Ellie's voices, The Swap offers a fresh and honest take on tween friendship, all while exploring more serious themes of family, loss, empathy, and what it really means to be yourself. And as Jon Scieszka says, it's "seriously, truly, fearlessly funny!"
						 <br>
						“The internal lives of both boy and girl come across as both authentic and heartwarming … Readers curious about how the other half lives will thrill at this view from the far side of the fence.” -Kirkus Reviews
						<br>
						“Bravo, Megan Shull! Hilarious and yet surprisingly touching at the same time, The Swap gives us a microscopically close insider's view at the differences (and similarities) between the lives of boys and girls. I don't know how Megan did it, but I'm really glad she did!” -Meg Cabot, author of The Princess Diaries<br>
						Born and raised in Ithaca, New York, Megan Shull is the author of several books for kids including the award-winning young adult novel Amazing Grace. Megan holds a doctorate in educational psychology from Cornell University, where she also earned her undergraduate degree. She lives in her hometown, where she feels especially lucky to walk the quiet rolling hills alongside red-tailed hawks and waterfalls.  Bring the whole family to hear Megan read from her latest YA book, ask your questions and get your books signed!
